## âš¡ Performance Optimization Tips

### Pipeline Efficiency
- [ ] **Use caching** for dependencies and build artifacts
- [ ] **Parallelize independent jobs** using `needs` keyword
- [ ] **Implement selective builds** with rules and changes
- [ ] **Use GitLab's merge trains** for efficient merging
- [ ] **Optimize Docker layer caching** in build stages
- [ ] **Compress artifacts** before storage

### Resource Management
- [ ] **Set appropriate resource limits** for jobs
- [ ] **Use spot/preemptible instances** for non-critical jobs
- [ ] **Implement job timeouts** to prevent runaway processes
- [ ] **Monitor pipeline performance** with GitLab metrics
- [ ] **Use GitLab's pipeline efficiency analytics**

### Build Optimization
- [ ] **Minimize context size** in Docker builds
- [ ] **Use multi-stage builds** for smaller final images
- [ ] **Implement incremental builds** where possible
- [ ] **Cache node_modules, pip cache, etc.** appropriately
- [ ] **Use GitLab's artifact dependencies** for efficient transfers

## ðŸ’° Cost Optimization Strategies

### Runner Costs
- [ ] **Use GitLab SaaS runners** for small projects (free tier)
- [ ] **Implement auto-scaling** for cloud runners
- [ ] **Use spot instances** for development/testing pipelines
- [ ] **Schedule heavy jobs** during off-peak hours
- [ ] **Implement job queuing** to optimize resource usage

### Storage Costs
- [ ] **Set artifact expiration** policies (7-30 days typically)
- [ ] **Compress artifacts** before storage
- [ ] **Use GitLab Pages** for static documentation
- [ ] **Implement cleanup policies** for old packages
- [ ] **Monitor storage usage** with GitLab analytics

### Pipeline Costs
- [ ] **Use `rules`** to skip unnecessary jobs
- [ ] **Implement manual jobs** for optional deployments
- [ ] **Use `interruptible`** for jobs that can be cancelled
- [ ] **Optimize job duration** to reduce compute costs
- [ ] **Use GitLab's cost analytics** to identify expensive jobs

## ðŸ“‹ Compliance Requirements

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- [ ] **Data minimization** - only collect necessary data
- [ ] **Implement data retention policies** with automatic cleanup
- [ ] **Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** for high-risk processing
- [ ] **Implement right to erasure** mechanisms
- [ ] **Document data processing activities** in records
- [ ] **Use encryption** for personal data at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Implement audit logging** for data access and processing

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- [ ] **Implement access controls** with audit trails
- [ ] **Use encryption** for Protected Health Information (PHI)
- [ ] **Conduct regular security risk assessments**
- [ ] **Implement incident response procedures**
- [ ] **Maintain business associate agreements** with service providers
- [ ] **Use secure coding practices** to prevent vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Implement data backup and disaster recovery** procedures

### SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)
- [ ] **Implement security monitoring** and alerting
- [ ] **Conduct regular vulnerability assessments**
- [ ] **Maintain change management procedures**
- [ ] **Implement logical access controls**
- [ ] **Conduct background checks** for personnel
- [ ] **Implement incident response and business continuity plans**
- [ ] **Maintain audit trails** for all system activities

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- [ ] **Use strong encryption** for cardholder data
- [ ] **Implement access control measures**
- [ ] **Regularly test security systems**
- [ ] **Maintain secure network configurations**
- [ ] **Protect cardholder data** throughout the environment
- [ ] **Implement strong access control measures**
- [ ] **Regularly monitor and test networks**

## ðŸ›  Implementation Examples

### Security Pipeline Template
```yaml
stages:
  - security
  - test
  - deploy

security_scan:
  stage: security
  script:
    - echo "Running security scans..."
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app security-tool scan
  artifacts:
    reports:
      sast: gl-sast-report.json
    expire_in: 1 week

dependency_check:
  stage: security
  script:
    - npm audit --audit-level high
  allow_failure: false
```

### Cost-Optimized Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
    - npm run build
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - .npm/
      - node_modules/
  artifacts:
    expire_in: 1 hour
    paths:
      - dist/

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:ci
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - .npm/
      - node_modules/
  coverage: '/COVERAGE:\s\d+\.\d+/'
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

### Compliance Monitoring Job
```yaml
compliance_check:
  stage: .post
  script:
    - echo "Running compliance checks..."
    - check-licenses
    - validate-security-policies
    - audit-access-logs
  artifacts:
    reports:
      license_scanning: gl-license-scanning-report.json
    expire_in: 1 month
  only:
    - main
    - develop
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: Target > 95%
- **Average Pipeline Duration**: Monitor trends
- **Cost per Pipeline**: Track against budget
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Aim for zero critical/high
- **Compliance Violations**: Target zero

### Monitoring Tools
- **GitLab CI/CD Analytics**: Built-in pipeline metrics
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Custom dashboards
- **ELK Stack**: Log aggregation and analysis
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Detection**: Monitor alerts and logs
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures and training

### Performance Incident Response
1. **Identify Bottleneck**: Use monitoring tools
2. **Scale Resources**: Auto-scale or manual intervention
3. **Optimize Code**: Fix performance issues
4. **Update Baselines**: Adjust monitoring thresholds
